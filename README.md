# Machine_Learning_Algorithms
Implementation of various machine learning algorithms from scratch

## K-means clustering
K-means clustering was implemented from scratch and compared with sklearn implementation by clustering the iris dataset

## GMM
Implementation of Gaussian Mixture Models for clustering in iris dataset.

## PCA
PCA was implemented from scratch on face images dataset and images were reconstructed from lower dimensional representations.

## k-NN
